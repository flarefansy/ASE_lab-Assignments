모모The store on the left raised bigger signs proclaiming, "Prices Slashed!" and "Fantastic Discounts!"
모모The owner in the middle then prepared a large sign that simply stated, "ENTRANCE".

During World War II, a lot of young women in Britain were in the army. Joan Phillips was one of them. She worked in a big camp, and of course met a lot of men, officers and soldiers.

모모"I몵m very pleased to meet you," the matron said, "I몵m his mother!"
